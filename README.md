# Subnautica Map
Interactive Map for Subnautica by Hendrik3303 (Still WIP)

This map is made to run locally in your browser

To run, Use for example Vs Code (or any IDE of your choice) and have python installed and call in bash following command (or different port): python -m http.server 8000. Or start it locally in any way you want this is just a suggestion
You can then go to localhost:8000 in your browser and you should see the map :)
